## 📌 Problem Statement

The objective was to build a predictive model using historical RedBus data to solve a real-world problem such as:

- **Demand Forecasting**
- **Price Prediction**
- **Route Optimization**
- **User Behavior Analysis**

This repo contains my full solution, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and result visualization.
